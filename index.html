        <strong>Current Support:</strong><br>
        This Month: $0<br>
        Last Month: ¥16,000<br><br>
        This is the reality.<br>
        The truth is not popular.<br>
        But I still stand.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
        <p>This is not a marketing campaign. Not a charity project. This is the voice of someone who survived what most never speak of.</p>
        <p>It exists because the world often forgets those who were never truly seen. Because when the lights are off, some of us still keep watch. This page is for them — and for you, if you choose to stand with us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I was abandoned at three months old. Raised in state care. Abused. Silenced. I became disabled in the second grade. I couldn’t study. I was overlooked. Mocked. Dismissed as lazy. But I never stopped living. Never stopped watching. Never stopped believing that someone else out there felt the same.</p>
        <p>Now, I use the small disability pension I receive not for myself, but to protect others — children who are still invisible, still hurting, still abandoned. Because no one else will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What This Supports</h2>
        <p>Every contribution goes directly to sustaining that quiet protection. To building spaces where forgotten children are seen. To designing systems that don’t depend on fame or funding, but on honor.</p>
        <p>No staff. No bureaucracy. Just one soul refusing to vanish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
        “We are not the saved.<br>
        We are the abandoned who chose to protect.”
